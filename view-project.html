        <h2>News Collecting App using Angular and Firebase</h2>
        <h4>Breakdown of the idea</h4>
        <p>
          I find it difficult in todays socity to know if the articals im
          reading are fake news or politically anged news. Also because of
          social media news travals really fast and gets twisted along the way.
          A sulotion to the readers problem would be to create a application
          that collects articals from diffrent news sources so that the readers
          can get a bigger picture of the information they are taking in.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Latest is a News collecting application built with Angular using
          three diffrent news api end-points to collect articals from differnt
          news sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          For every artical there is a implemented comment section and rating
          system for users to write their thoughts and to rate the artical.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used Firebase-store as my data storage for the comments and the
          ratings so that when the page is reload the comments will still be
          save and displayed on the application.
