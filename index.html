          <h2>News Collecting App using Angular and Firebase</h2>
          <h4>Breakdown of the idea</h4>
          <p>
            I find it difficult in todays society to know if the articles I'm
            reading are fake news or politically angled news. Also because of
            how news travels really fast because of social media and gets
            twisted along the way. A solution to the problem would be to create
            a application that collects articles from different news sources so
            that it's easier to create a bigger picture of the information thats
            given.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Latest is a News collecting application built with Angular using
            three different news api end-points to collect articles from
            different news sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            For every article there is a comment and rating section system for
            users to write their thoughts and to give the article a raiting.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used Firebase cloud-store as my data storage for the comments and
            the ratings so that when the page is reload the comments will still
            be save and displayed on the application.

            Brief interpretation: "Help the user find relevant information and
            interact with the content."

          <p>
            This is a project for Global Resilience Partnership that me and my
            five team-mates worked on during five weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The develop process was structured with two weeks only focusing on
            designing a prototype in Figma and the last three weeks we developed
            the website prototype by mob coding sessions using the react
            framework.
